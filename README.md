## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **PHP** (>= 8.2.4) installed on your local machine.
- **Apache** (>= 2.4.56) installed and configured.
- **MySQL** (>= 8.2.4) or MariaDB database server.
- **Git** You'll need Git to clone the repository.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

<!-- :open_file_folder: -->
## üìÇ Clone the Repository <a name = "clone"></a>

Open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedShwabi/maktabati
```
## üíª Setting Up the Environment <a name = "environment"></a>
1. Configure your web server to serve the project from the cloned directory. For example, with Apache, you can create a virtual host configuration:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName maktabati.local
    DocumentRoot "/path/to/maktabati"
    <Directory "/path/to/maktabati">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
Replace "/path/to/maktabati" with the actual path to your project directory.

2. Update your system's hosts file to point the domain to your local machine. On most systems, you can find this file at /etc/hosts (Linux/Mac) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows). Add an entry like this:

```lua
127.0.0.1   maktabati.local
```

## üíæ Database Setup <a name = "db_setup"></a>
1. Create a MySQL or MariaDB database for maktabati. You can do this using a tool like phpMyAdmin or via the command line:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE maktabati;
```
2. Import the 'maktabati.sql' file into your newly created database. You can do this using the command-line MySQL client:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p maktabati < maktabati.sql
```
Replace 'your_username' with your database username and enter the corresponding password when prompted.

3. Verify that the tables and test data have been imported successfully:

```sql
USE maktabati;
SHOW TABLES;
```
This should display a list of tables, indicating that the database setup was successful.

## üöÄ Running the Project <a name = "running_project"></a>
Now that you have set up the project and the database, you can run the maktabati project on your local web server. Open a web browser and navigate to http://maktabati.local (or the domain you configured in your web server).

2. enter the following credential to login to the web panel:
```js
email: mohamed@gmail.com
password: 123
```
